# Basic Sales Chart

## Description

The project showcases modern Vue.js development practices, leveraging the latest features and libraries to create a robust and user-friendly application for managing and analyzing daily sales data. The use of TypeScript and Pinia contributes to a scalable and maintainable codebase, making it suitable for future enhancements and feature additions.

## Technologies Used

- [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/): Used for the user interface.
- [Pinia](https://pinia.esm.dev/): Used for state management in Vue applications. While Vuex is a great state management solution, especially for smaller applications or when using Vue 2, Pinia's TypeScript support, modular design, and performance optimizations make it an attractive choice for larger and more complex Vue 3 projects. Pinia was used instead of Vuex for the following reasons:

  - TypeScript Support
  - Modular Store Design
  - Composable API
  - Reactiveness and Devtools
  - Ecosystem Integration

- [Vue-ApexCharts](https://apexcharts.com/vue-chart-demos/): Used for creating charts.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/): Used for making HTTP requests.
